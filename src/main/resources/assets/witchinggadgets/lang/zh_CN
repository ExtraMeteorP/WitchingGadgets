witchinggadgets_research_name.WALLMIRROR=魔镜
witchinggadgets_research_text.WALLMIRROR=[WG] The most magical of all!
witchinggadgets_research_page.WALLMIRROR.1=Further delving into the magic of the mirrors has lead you to the discovery of a safe haven within the void between worlds.<BR>While this location is brimming with magic, otherwise it appears to be void of anything. It has no visible layer of flooring, yet somehow you can stand there.<BR>This space seems to be an excellent way of traveling.

These blocks can be replaced with normal blocks by right-clicking them, allowing you to build there. Jump to ascend, the floor will follow you. Holding the sneak key will make you descend.

#WGPOTIONS
witchinggadgets_research_name.WGPOTIONS=Status Effects
witchinggadgets_research_text.WGPOTIONS=[WG] Milk is not always an option! 
witchinggadgets_research_page.WGPOTIONS.1=When delving into the arcane, you may come about certain afflictions. This is a list of the known ones:<BR><IMG>witchinggadgets:textures/gui/potioneffects.png:18:198:18:18:1</IMG>§nKnockback resistance:§r  Grants the afflicted a chance to resist knockback, with a chance of 33% per level.<IMG>witchinggadgets:textures/gui/potioneffects.png:36:198:18:18:1</IMG>§nDissolving:§r  The afflicted is covered in a fluid akin to 'Liquid Death', damaging them over time. If they succumb to it, they drop crystalized aspects.
witchinggadgets_research_page.WGPOTIONS.2=<IMG>witchinggadgets:textures/gui/potioneffects.png:54:198:18:18:1</IMG>§nCinder Coat:§r  The afflicted is coated in magical cinder, which heightens the potency of flames. All fire damage is multiplied based on the strength of the effect.



witchinggadgets_research_name.ETHEREALWALL=缥缈之墙
witchinggadgets_research_text.ETHEREALWALL=[WG] 躲入眼前
witchinggadgets_research_page.ETHEREALWALL.1=仅仅对奥术石砖的魔力进行一点改善，你就已经发现了一个有趣的现象。给这种石砖提供一个红石信号就能使它变成§o非物质§r方块，这将使你能通过它。<BR>这同样也会影响到连接着被充能的石砖的石砖<BR>除此之外，你甚至可以使这种方块的外观变得和其他正常方块无异，仅仅只需用手中的方块右击它即可，而蹲下空手右击会使它的伪装消失。
witchinggadgets_research_page.ETHEREALWALL.2=除此之外，你甚至可以使这种方块的外观变得和其他正常方块无异，仅仅只需用手中的方块右击它即可，而蹲下空手右击会使它的伪装消失。(It will only accept the texture of normally rendered blocks. Vanilla transparency works, Thaumcraft's Amber doesn't because it's coloured transparency, directional textures like wooden logs and quartz pillars are not fully supported)
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.STONEEXTRUDER=Thaumic Stone Extruder
witchinggadgets_research_text.STONEEXTRUDER=[WG] One can never have enough stone
witchinggadgets_research_page.STONEEXTRUDER.1=Even those that are not skilled in the arts of Thaumaturgy are aware of how flowing lava will solidify into cobblestone when cooled by water. Those skilled in the magical arts don't want to waste their time on the tedious digging of these stones and have therefore created an automated way.<BR>This machine will create cobblestone, break it and place it either on the ground or into a connected inventory. Work will be halted if the inventory is full or a redstone signal is applied. You can use a wand to rotate it.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.AGEINGSTONE=生长之石
witchinggadgets_research_text.AGEINGSTONE=[WG] 玩乐之时，时间飞逝
witchinggadgets_research_page.AGEINGSTONE.1=所有年轻的神秘使都想快快长大，但这将会使你失去许多美好的经历。因此取而代之，你决定通过你现有的知识，将时间的艺术转变为奥术石砖的另一种形式。<BR>生长之石将会使大多数常见的生物的生长速度加快。当小羊、小牛和小猪接触到这种神奇的魔力时，它们的生长速度比原来更快。<BR>生长之石作用于以自身为中心的7×7×5范围内的所有生物。更多的方块，更强的魔力。

witchinggadgets_research_name.SPINNINGWHEEL=Spinning
witchinggadgets_research_text.SPINNINGWHEEL=[WG] Don't prick yourself
witchinggadgets_research_page.SPINNINGWHEEL.1=While many great Wizards neglect the practice of spinning and weaving, many of them do that by underestimating its true power. A number of magical artifacts are the product of clothwork, including every thaumaturge's robes. Some witches will testify that spellcrafting in itself even has a lot in common with weaving, requiring careful handling of the respective components; be it raw magic in its aspects or thread.
witchinggadgets_research_page.SPINNINGWHEEL.2=             §lCrafting§r<LINE>Every practitioners start into the field should be made by creating their very own §lSpinning Wheel§r. It will be used if in aquiring yarn, be it mundane, of exquisite material or some enhanced with magic. This yarn will then later be used to weave the fabric from which to craft various garments or magic artifacts. See the §lLoom§r for further details.

witchinggadgets_research_name.LOOM=Loom
witchinggadgets_research_text.LOOM=[WG] Weavin' Magic
witchinggadgets_research_page.LOOM.1=To process further the process the yarn and thread gained by spinning, the wizard will have to craft himself a magic loom on which to weave his magic fabric. This  construct will not only interweave the threads, it will also infuse them with various §lAspects§r, granting them magical properties. To infuse the fabric with aspects, simply make sure a §lWarded Jar§r containing some is in the vicinity<BR>To start the weaving after setting the recipe, simply tap the loom with your wand.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.ARCANEAUTOCRAFTER=Arcane Crafter
witchinggadgets_research_text.ARCANEAUTOCRAFTER=[WG] Au-Thaum-nomous Crafting!
witchinggadgets_research_page.ARCANEAUTOCRAFTER.1=Those mages who discovered the secrets of immortality (you recognize them by the long, white beard) have all the time in the world. But what about your average thaumaturge? In order to save yourself some time, why not let someone else do the tedious and repetitive crafting operations? Of course, no one would entrust a golem with something as powerful as a wand, but this semi-sentient wooden table will do nicely.
witchinggadgets_research_page.ARCANEAUTOCRAFTER.2=Simply set your preferred recipe (normal recipe or arcane crafting), provide it with the materials and, if needed, a charged wand, and wait for it to do your bidding. Note however, that the knowledge of crafting is limited to that of the player who put down the block.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.CALCULATOR=Arcane Abacus
witchinggadgets_research_text.CALCULATOR=[WG] 3-4 = Warp?
witchinggadgets_research_page.CALCULATOR.1=As a skilled thaumaturge, close to achieving eldritch knowledge, you are an expert on chaos. ...It might also stem from your lack of mathematical knowledge. But who would bother themselves with sciences of the common man when there are enchantments that do it for you?<BR>The Arcane Abacus will take some of the mundane mathematics off your hands. Use it on a Node that contains compound aspects and it will calculate it to primal values. Use it on an Infusion Matrix to check the stability value and point out misplaced stabilizers.
witchinggadgets_research_page.CALCULATOR.2=§oThe highest infusion instability known to man *cough*Thaumic Tinkerer*cough* is 15. Stabilizing your altar beyond that is pointless.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.LABYRINTHSTRING=Guiding Thread
witchinggadgets_research_text.LABYRINTHSTRING=[WG] Ariadne would be proud
witchinggadgets_research_page.LABYRINTHSTRING.1=Mazes and labyrinths once were a favourable way of warding secrets against intruders. The real danger of course, is not finding your way back out.<BR>In order to help with that, you have designed the Guiding Thread, an item that leaves a trail of light as you progress through dark and windy place. Rightclick to activate or deactivate it. While active, it will remember every turn you make. The light is only visible while you hold it though. Sneak+click to wipe it's memory.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.LABELLIB=Aspect Library
witchinggadgets_research_text.LABELLIB=[WG] Indexing made easy!
witchinggadgets_research_page.LABELLIB.1=While managing and archiving the different kinds of essentia you deal with, you have found that labeling them is quite tedious work. In order to no longer bottle up essentia and rub it against a label to get the the right colour, you've designed the aspect library. It is a block that remembers every aspect you have discovered so far and applies it to labels. Simply place a label within it and select an aspect, and it will attune it accordingly.

#
witchinggadgets_research_name.BAGOFTRICKS=Bag of Tricks
witchinggadgets_research_text.BAGOFTRICKS=[WG] Did I hear an echo in there?
witchinggadgets_research_page.BAGOFTRICKS.1=Further advancements in magical weaving have led you to the discovery of the §lCloth of Spacious Folds§r. A most interesting weave, which seems to contain more room in its folds than visible from the outside. Crafting a bag from this provides you with space for storage to easily carry on your person.<BR>The fabric also turns out to be very protective of its contents, and it will harm any but the owner, should they try to access the bag. §oThis behaviour can be toggled by the owner by sneak+rightlick.§r
witchinggadgets_research_page.BAGOFTRICKS.r1=<IMG>witchinggadgets:textures/gui/research/weavingRecipes1.png:0:0:255:255:0.5</IMG>§lCloth of Spacious Folds§r
witchinggadgets_research_page.BAGOFTRICKS.2=Any of the bags created from the cloth are dyeable, craft them without any dye to return them to their default colour.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.ADVANCEDROBES=Bewitched Fleece
witchinggadgets_research_text.ADVANCEDROBES=[WG] Sizzling with Magic
witchinggadgets_research_page.ADVANCEDROBES.1=The dark side of §mthe force§r Thaumaturgy holds a lot of power. By slightly tapping into that power, you can weave a fabric much more rich of magic. With that, you can now make yourself better garments strengthened in their magic potential.
witchinggadgets_research_page.ADVANCEDROBES.r1=<IMG>witchinggadgets:textures/gui/research/weavingRecipes4.png:0:0:255:255:0.5</IMG>§lBewitched Fleece§r
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.CLOAK=Cloak
witchinggadgets_research_text.CLOAK=[WG] Swish!
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK.1=After noticing the excellent "swishing"-properties of Enchanted Fabric, you have quickly drawn out some schematics to create a cloak from it. While this standard cloak lacks any special abilities, its magical fabric should provide an excellent base for more advanced spellwoven mantles.<BR>§oTo be equipped in the Traveller's Gear inventory, the default keybinding is 'Numpad 7'. Certain abilities of the advanced cloaks can be activated. This is done via the 'Active Abilities'-menu of Traveller's Gear. The default keybinding is 'R'.§r
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.CLOAK_STORAGE=Cloak of Voluminous Pockets
witchinggadgets_research_text.CLOAK_STORAGE=[WG] I lost my keys in here...
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_STORAGE.1=Combining the concept of your Bag of Tricks with that of the fashionable cloak, you now have more storage capabilities right on your body! The cloak also has 50% more capacity.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.CLOAK_RAVEN=Mantle of the Raven
witchinggadgets_research_text.CLOAK_RAVEN=[WG] CA-CAW!
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_RAVEN.1=On your travels throughout the Twilight Forest, you have come across the most fascinating Forest Raven. This remarkable bird displays high agility and maneuverability in the air, a feat to be envious of.<BR>Instead of being envious you could also just adorne your cloak with their feathers and imbue it with magical power...<BR>While wearing this cloak, your speed while flying increases noticeably. And should you not be flying, the cloak will allow you to glide instead. Gliding can be disabled in the ActiveAbility menu.
# OLD witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_RAVEN.1=On your travels throughout the Twilight Forest, you have come across the most fascinating Forest Raven. This remarkable bird appears to always find back to his nesting place, even within the dense and dark forest it calls home.<BR>Plucking a feather from it, you have discovered that it, albeit in small scale, inherits this ability. Now you just have to amplify this ability with your thaumic capabilities and infuse your garment with it. The result is the §lMantle of the Raven§r which allows you to set and return to your nesting place at the cost of a raven's feather. You may substitute three chicken feathers.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.CLOAK_SPECTRAL=Spectral Mantle
witchinggadgets_research_text.CLOAK_SPECTRAL=[WG] Now you see me...
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_SPECTRAL.1=The plane of the spectral beings is a mystery to most common men. Fortunately, you are not most men. After infusing a cloak with eldritch and spectral energies it will grant you the ability to 'shift' yourself to that plane. While walking among it, you are invisble to those that walk along the normal plane. Enemies will not see or target you unless they are creatures of eldritch, posses exemptual powers or are wearing Goggles of Revealing.<BR>This ability comes at the cost of being unable to interact with the physical world. You cannot attack, use items, break or activate blocks. Furthermore it will drain 1 aer vis from you inventory every 5 seconds.
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_SPECTRAL.2=§oDisclaimer: Creatures that can still see you include: Eldritch Guardians, Eldritch Wardens, Eldritch Golems, Cultist Praetors, as well as boss mobs like the Wither or the Enderdragon. Any other user of this cloak will also be able to see you.§r
#Creating a cloak that is invisible is an easy task for a thaumaturge, but applying the effect to it's wearer was the hard task. After tedious research however, you have created the §lCloak of Invisibility§r, a garment that renders you invisible to the naked eye. The cloak itself lost a bit of his magic in the process, now only turning mostly transparent, leaving a slight shimmer. Other armor pieces or items that you are holding in your hand are not affected.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.CLOAK_WOLF=Cloak of the Wolf
witchinggadgets_research_text.CLOAK_WOLF=[WG] What a big mouth you have!
witchinggadgets_research_page.CLOAK_WOLF.1=The old tales tell of the berserkers, unrelenting warriors, imbued by ancient magic and wrapped in the fur of a wolf.<BR>Your studies have revealed magical procedures like these and for reasons of style and nostalgia you decided they were best integrated into a cloak of wolf fur. Should you sustain damage while wearing it, you gain additional attack damage and speed, akin to the fearless warriors of old.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.ENDERBAG=Enderlinked Bag
witchinggadgets_research_text.ENDERBAG=[WG] Everywhere and nowhere at once!
witchinggadgets_research_page.ENDERBAG.1=By attuning your Bag of Tricks to the enderic frequencies of your personal Ender Chest, you now have access to its contents from anywhere in the world.<BR>Don't try to turn it inside out.
#
witchinggadgets_research_name.WGBAUBLES=Witching Wearables
witchinggadgets_research_text.WGBAUBLES=[WG] It's like a magic boutique
witchinggadgets_research_page.WGBAUBLES.1=What looks like catalogue pages from a wizarding equipment store actually proved to be arcane shematics for magical garments! §oAll of these are to be equipped in Baubles or Traveller's Gear slots. The default keybinding for the TG inventory is 'Numpad 7'.§r<BR>§lSteadfast Spaulders:§r<BR>These shoulderpads are not designed to be very fashionable, and their protection value is negligable. However, the magic infused into them is able to root you to the floor, so that you shall not waver when stuck by enemy attacks. §oGrants you 60% knockback resistance.§r
witchinggadgets_research_page.WGBAUBLES.2=§lBerserker's Bracers:§r<BR>Covered in wolven fur, these vambraces wont hold off blades. But by the magic infused into them, they grant the user the ferociousness of a wolf. Also, they are incredibly fluffy.<BR>§oIncreases your attack damage by 2 points.§r
witchinggadgets_research_page.WGBAUBLES.3=§lVambraces of Steady Progression:§r<BR>These vambraces, designed by dwarven thaumaturgists, are designed to grant you the ability of digging a hole at a steady pace without interruption. To achieve that, they react dynamically to the working conditions, increasing the user's dig speed while sumberged in water, flying in the air, or when confronted with highly resilient materials.<BR>They also increase the speed at which you climb ladders, for when you eventually need to outrun the thing you woke in the dark below.

witchinggadgets_research_page.INFERNALBLASTFURNACE.1=Burning with an intensely hot magical flame, this furnace is the Thaumaturge's response to the engineer's tedious steps of cleaning their ores. It will smelt any clusters of metal thrown within it into three ingots, which the occasional nugget added to that.<BR>Furthermore, should you require steel for other operations, the impure flame of this devilish artifact is a surefire way to get it.

witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.1=Gemcutting is one of the oldest yet most refined forms of giving magic a physical form. If a gem is infused with magic, it is no longer dependant on the user. Any mortal can use the power stored inside a cut gem, making this a viable option of giving power to those not skilled in the thaumaturgic arts.<BR>Gems vary in their function based on their cut and the magical essence infused into them.
witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.2=§lNatural Affinities§r<BR>Some stones have inheirent natural affinities for certain aspects, which applies a natural strengthening to their effect. If the affinity matches the infused aspect, the gem will be enchanted with "Brilliance", the level depending on the amount of essences used in the creation.<BR>§lNatural Aversions§r<BR>Similarly, some gems have natural aversions to certain aspect, and infusing them with them will make the resulting gem brittle, weakening it's effect and adding a chance for reuseable gems to break.<BR> Hold shift while looking at a gem to see its affinites and aversions.

witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.5=              §lOval Cut§r<LINE>The oval cut is an advanced form of the infused gems. With the increase in facettes, it can store much more energy and release it in smaller, concentrated bursts. The effects are quite different from those of the point cut gems and these can be recharged with vis of a matching aspect.<BR>Due to its complexety, using a base gem without a natural affinity for the aspect makes the resulting gem very brittle, and in turn, the essentia required to create a brilliant gem has increased.
witchinggadgets_research_page.GEMCUTTING.6=§e§lAer: §r§0The energies propell you through their air. Consumes 1 charge per use.<BR>§2§lTerra: §r§0Upon using it on a block, it checks connected blocks for ores. Consumes 1 charge per use.<BR>§c§lIgnis: §r§0Starts a fire at the targeted block.

They contained plans for an armorset designed to channel the energies of the void through gemstones. Sadly, only sketches of the gauntlet were decipherable.<BR>This gauntlet features an inbuilt §5Node Transducer§0, and when its claws close upon a node, it will never let it go again, unless it is replaced by another.<BR>The five sockets on this device will accept infused gems, and their power can be channeled through it, while their recharge speed is based on the aspects of the contained node.
witchinggadgets_research_page.PRIMORDIALGLOVE.2=It should be noted that the sockets will stabilize the gems inside them, so they will never break upon use, but simply recharge.<BR>To select the active gem, the same keybinding as for switching wand foci is used.

Not only do all carry a unique innert ability, each is tuneable to a primal affinity, granting it further effects. And don't be scared by their massive apearance, for their wielder does not feel their weight, unlike the target upon which they are swung.
witchinggadgets_research_page.PRIMORDIALWEAPONRY.2=The Primordial Claymore seems to assist you in aiming your strikes. The blade commonly hits your foe's neck, resulting in decapitation.<BR>The Primordial Warhammer uses its immense weight to literally squash your foes.

witchinggadgets_research_text.EMPOWERPEARL=[WG] 120 bpm
witchinggadgets_research_page.EMPOWERPEARL.1=The power that once pulsed through Primordial Pearl is gone. Well, not gone, just infused into a different item. But not all hope is lost! The pearl itself still exists, you just have to empower it once more, by infusing it...


#VOIDBAG
witchinggadgets_research_name.VOIDBAG=Voidlinked Bag
witchinggadgets_research_text.VOIDBAG=[WG] Supermassive Black Hole
witchinggadgets_research_page.VOIDBAG.1=Don't you just hate picking up all that useless cobblestone? Wouldn't it be much better if it just vanished? Well here is your solution! A bag of magical cloth, infused with the energies of the void, which destroys the physical matter of all things inserted into it and sets the magical energies of that item free.<BR>How to work it: Open it up and give it examples of the items you would like to go into it. Then, when that item is picked up (only works on in-world pickups, not on items added to your inventory through other means), they will be destroyed and a random primal aspect contained within them is given to you as vis, charging your wand. 


# ADVANCED SCRIBING TOOLS
witchinggadgets_research_name.ADVANCEDSCRIBINGTOOLS=Advanced Inscription
witchinggadgets_research_text.ADVANCEDSCRIBINGTOOLS=[WG] Mightier than the sword
witchinggadgets_research_page.ADVANCEDSCRIBINGTOOLS.1=Every thaumaturge knows the pain of aquiring the ink necessary to further his studies. More often than not, he has to hunt for squids himself! To avoid these troubles in future, you have thought up a much more potent set of scribing tools. They might be expensive in their creation, but their pool of magical ink is ten times the size of normal scribing tools. And to top that, it is not refilled by ink sacks cut out from slimey squids, but from purest light and some small quantities of gold.
# ELITE RUNIC ARMOR
witchinggadgets_research_name.ELITERUNICARMOR=Elite Runic Armor
witchinggadgets_research_text.ELITERUNICARMOR=[WG] Overshield!
witchinggadgets_research_page.ELITERUNICARMOR.1=While runic armor is an excellent form of protection, you have come to realize that you can also apply these runes to actual armor. With that you are not only granted normal armor, the bigger surface also allows more runes, increasing the pool of runes this armor provides. A wise mage would use the newly aquired set of scribing tools, because this procedure drains a hundred units of ink and a standard pen would break from this.

witchinggadgets_research_page.DEMONIC_CHEST.1=And his victims fell before his feet. While one is wearing this cuirass, they are not only granted the power of flight, but health leeching abilities as well. Upon killing any living creature, the wearer of this infernal armor absorbs part of their very life-force This allows the aforementioned wearer to add twenty percent of the killed creatures health to its own, appearing as absorption hitpoints. These extra units of health last only ten minutes. Only creatures with 10 hearts or more are valid prey for this spell. If that wasn't enough, the wearer is granted twenty seconds of heightened saturation upon killing any creature
#witchinggadgets_research_page.DEMONIC_CHEST.1=And his victims fell before his feet. While one is wearing this cuirass, they are granted the power of flight. Furthermore, they, upon killing any other living creature, absorb a part of their health. This adds 20% of the creature's health as absorption hitpoints which last for 10 minutes. Only targets with 10 hearts or more are valid. These hitpoints stack up to 10 extra hearts and the timer is reset each time. Furthermore, upon killing any living creature the wearer is granted 20 seconds of saturation.

witchinggadgets_research_page.DEMONIC_LEGS.1=Werewolves are ferocious beasts. Even more so when provoked. These greaves, imbued with the aspects that represent them, grant you their immense speed. Should you be attacked, they send you into a blood rage, drastically increasing your damage. While sprinting, hold the assigned key (default: Ctrl) to gain a haste buff.

witchinggadgets_research_page.DEMONIC_BOOTS.1=These clawed feet will allow you to run at higher speed, and wont take damage on falling. It's claws also allow you to scale walls. Crouching before you jump will allow you to jump higher, but this might result in damage to the blocks below you.

witchinggadgets_research_text.ANGELIC_CHEST=[WG] Blinded by the light!
witchinggadgets_research_page.ANGELIC_CHEST.1=While wearing this cuirass, the Thaumaturge is strengthened by the powers of light. They are granted the ability to fly and get strengthened by the light. The brighter the light you're standing in, the higher your chance to regenerate some health. Finally, this cuirass contains otherworldly pockets allowing you to store items in it. Open them with the keybinding for using cloaks (default: 'G').

witchinggadgets_research_name.SCANCAMERA=Thaumic Iconograph
witchinggadgets_research_text.SCANCAMERA=[WG] There is no Imp inside!
witchinggadgets_research_page.SCANCAMERA.1=Experiments with the magical mirrored glass have shown that under certain conditions, it will not reflect images but store them. Using this to your advantage, you can store thaumic imprints of objects you find on your travels on glass panes. Later then, you can transfer these imprints to paper, in order to share your experinces with other Thaumaturges at the next arcane council.
witchinggadgets_research_page.SCANCAMERA.2=Use the §lThaumic Iconograph Box§r like you would use the Thaumometer. You can create a §lIconographic Plate§r of anything you would usually scan at the cost of a §lMirrored Glass§r from your inventory. You can take iconographs even of things you have previously scanned, but only the use of a §lDeveloped Iconograph§r grants you the research aspects. And this studying of the picture abides by the same rule as the scan with the Thaumometer. Increase the number of ink and paper in the development recipe to create more than one copy of the picture.
